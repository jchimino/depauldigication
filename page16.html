    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chad Asplund and Francis O’Connor write of an, “uncommon” sudden cardiac
death (SCD) event. This SCD, “is highly visible and generates a significant amount of
media and community attention.” The event is plural and often times, affects a youth
athlete in the high school or college setting. Rhetoric Chad Asplund uses in the article,
The Evidence Against Cardiac Screening Using Electrocardiogram in Athletes, does a
wonderful job at minimizing the effects of SCD, just as the article he previously co
authored, Cardiac Preparticipation Screening for the Young Athlete . In negating any
reason for electrocardiogram (ECG) policy, the title indicates and holds true much
evidence against ECG use in today’s sporting organizations. Albeit, the article lags
behind their membership’s stance written as the Interassociation Consensus Statement
on Cardiovascular Care of College Student Athletes, by Brian Hainline et al.
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In refuting the need to use electrocardiogram in pre participation screenings, the
introduction of Chad Asplund’s article opens by disproving a Veneto, Italian study that
witnessed an 89% decrease in SCD within the Veneto region. Their argument became
suspicion of heterogenous populations in the US being inherently wired distinctly from
Italian homogenous populations, so much as to determine an ECGs ability to have
similar effects. The introduction also deciphers between various heart conditions that
are more or less detectable by electrocardiogram, such as WolffParkinsonWhite
syndrome, Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and long QT syndrome. The introduction then
closes with the automated external defibrillator as a solution in the same sentence the
authors acknowledge their peers making progress in the field of ECG interpretation
(Asplund, 81).
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Incidence section is next, presenting statistics that are converted into
relevantly low prevalence rates. As rates are minimized, it’s compared and on par with
sudden deaths by drug use and suicides. In a transitional paragraph, the author
Chimino 2
disputes HCM as a detectable cause prevalent enough for anyone to warrant any
widespread use of the ECG (Asplund, 82).</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A foundation is then described for an exemplary screening process. If any
process were to be implemented, it should have the ability to influence a disease or
health outcome for the public, to be sensitive, specific, acceptable, and to also have
high enough prevalence in the population screened. ECG screening is then argued to
not meet this criteria, which leads the reader to believe utilizing the ECG technology in
preparticipation screening as unnecessary (Asplund, 82). Complications are then
attributed to subsequent and additional care or testing. As well, the authors cite an
undeveloped infrastructure of untrained specialists that limit screening interpretations. In
the same paragraph, the authors acknowledge available online learning resources for
the medical industry to utilize (Asplund, 83). These resources could assist in the
medical industry reaching that standard of interpretation but only if policy and procedure
of ECG screening is implemented, otherwise those resources become wasted. At
another point, the author stretches furthest to hint that repercussions from ECG
screening such as arterial injury, thrombus formations or arrhythmias may have a more
profound negative impact than SCD (Asplund, 83). As well, it’s stated our best chance
of survival lies in having rapid access to defibrillation and an emergency action plan
(EAP). These precautions are necessary and while they may limit worst case scenarios
of SCD, they do not prevent the scenario. At best, automated external defibrillation and
EAPs are safety net measures that should be considered a last resort. In their
conclusion, Chad Asplund nearly redacts his stance and announces, “to determine
these things, we need large scale randomized clinical trials to measure outcomes…”
(Asplund, 84).
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a sport, fitness and recreational leader, one must stay informed on this debate
as it most certainly impacts athletic programs and athletes across the spectrum. As a
coach or trainer, policy and procedures should be adhered to closely to limit negative
outcomes but to also see potential alternatives and drawbacks. Also, physicians like
Chad Asplund and Francis O’Connor, while refuting the need for ECG screening, may
Chimino 3
indirectly create awareness or more beneficial standards in the process of pointing out
faults or inefficiencies. As one may hope such recommended policy is based off a
broader consensus, which may not be the case. Even still, it is imperative for one to
challenge that consensus to ensure safety and care for our student athletes is not
misguided. Knowing the history and progression of the ECG debate allows coaches and
trainers that possibility. With student athletes at the forefront of our concerns, in utilizing
the article’s information to implement preemptive measures, a sport fitness and
recreation leader may also find solutions or better efficiencies unseen by medical staff.
In creating the most efficient preparticipation screening process, any point of view or
alternative may offer sporting organizations the policy needed to ensure safety and care
for the student athlete. While I disagree with this article’s stance, I do agree with their
conclusion. At the very least, we must begin to determine these variables with a large
scale, randomized clinical trial</p></div>
