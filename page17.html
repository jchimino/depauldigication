    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 1990 headline in USA Today read, “ Athletes at Risk: many put health, even life on the
line to pla y.” (McCaffrey, 177) This implies injuries can be sustained from competitive sport as
most are well aware of the damage our bodies endure throughout athletic seasons. It also
suggests there are risks associated with the unknown, which is why we train and hope our
movements and reaction times are quick enough to dodge a punch in boxing, break a tackle in
football, avoid a collision in soccer or balance our bodies in gymnastics, but what about when
that risk is internal? What about when that risk is the very blood flowing through your veins or
the rapid beat of your heart? It is difficult to prepare for or even be aware of those risks.
Twentysix
years after that infamous headline, I believe science and technology can drastically
minimize that internal risk with various precautions.
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cardiovascular disease (CVD), defined as a collective term for various diseases of the
heart and blood vessels, affects more than 81 million Americans. 47% of adults aged 18 and over
have some form of CVD (Insel, 265266)
This reflection will concentrate on what is the worst
possible outcome of CVD, which would be death. Specifically, sudden unexpected, or cardiac,
death (SUD), which is defined as death by cardiac arrest up to 6 hours after the initial onset of
symptoms (McCaffrey, 177). A direct cause of SUD is determined to be ventricular tachycardia
although it is a group of conditions that may affect the athlete’s cardiovascular system. These
conditions include; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), coronary artery abnormalities,
kawasaki disease, atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, myocarditis, marfan syndrome, mitral
valve prolapse and dysrhythmias (McCaffrey). Regardless of the cause or condition, the common
denominator is the heart; a person’s only muscle that never rests.
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While minimal in quantity and comparison to other causes of death, such as cancer or
stroke, it is estimated that 5 in every 100,000 young athletes are vulnerable to SUD (McCaffrey,
177). Also, aside from syncope or dyspnea, SUD may be the initial symptom (McCaffrey, 177).
Barry Maron, a cardiologist at Tufts Medical Center, found 1,049 instances of cardiac arrest in
Chimino 2
young athletes since 1980 and has determined on average since 2000, sixtysix
occurred each
year (Maron, “Sudden Death,” 1085). It may not be of much concern or priority with so few
instances but it has recently been associated with the MYH7 gene, or 17 others, all related to
HCM. This gene is known to cause an enlarged heart, which may be mistaken in athletes as
normal (Epstein, 247).
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it may not seem to affect a vast majority of the world, of those 1,049 families, a
part of their world. Each of them were somebody’s teammate, son or daughter, possibly
someone’s brother or sister, uncle, nephew or niece. One of them was my friend. In 2009, before
his senior season was to begin at Samford University, basketball player Jimmy Griffin passed
away following a nightly workout and pick up game after complaining of chest pain due to an
unknown heart ailment, he was just 23 years old. If only the future was then, what now may be
considered universal technology, a watch or bracelet detecting one’s heartbeat through their wrist
could have detected any number of red flags associated with cardiovascular disease, and possibly
saving his life.
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That USA Today article was written to the tragic event of Hank Gathers, an All American
forward for Loyola Marymount’s basketball team that led the nation in scoring and rebounding,
who collapsed not once, but twice during high performance competition. Although his
cardiovascular condition was diagnosed and later questioned, three months after his first
syncopal episode, in Loyola Marymount’s conference tournament, Hank again suffered from a
ventricular tachyarrhythmia where attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful. Regardless of
which CVD condition Hank had, he wasn’t obese nor did he smoke, infact he was quite the
opposite. He was a brute force of talent, skill and explosion. During competition, his elevated
heart rate pumped blood throughout his body as if it were a big block engine. At one point, it
elevated too high causing that fateful tachyarrhythmia. Let’s place Hank in today's culture. We
could strap a FitBit Pro to his wrist to track his heart rate. Then prior to his collapse on live
television, if the coach couldn’t be warned to substitute him, a sideline monitor could alarm
nearby medical staff of a potential, extremely dangerous rising heart rate that could have
prevented a sudden unexpected death. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do it for heart transplant patients, we do it for some elderly and we did it for the
professional soccer player Anthony Van Loo. An internal defibrillator had been surgically placed
inside his chest to jump start any issues. Anthony had a cardiac arrest episode during a soccer
match only to fall, spasm, cringe and pop right back up as if nothing had happened (Epstein,
251).With athletes doped up on energy drinks, caffeine running through their veins and pressures
amounting to millions and millions of dollars in professional contracts, it’s time science, the
NCAA and professional leagues around the world realize the need to ensure high performance
athletes have their safety net. At least for those individuals who push their body to the brink of
explosion. An indicator or simply a device wrapped around their wrist to forewarn medical staff
on site of any internal issues could save lives.
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Italy since 1980, electrocardiographic screening is a participation requirement for
competitive athletes. Efficacy is proven in the 89% decline of SUD among athletes. Only
recently in 2009 has the International Olympic Committee endorsed such an approach to
disqualify anyone that fails the exam (Pelliccia, 702). More recently in February of 2015, the
Miami Heat sidelined their 118 million dollar star player, Chris Bosh, for 8 months as a blood
clot was found in his lungs after complaining of chest pain. Although different symptoms, do
you think the NCAA would have approved of Hank Gathers playing if he was due $118 million?
As a basketball coach and sport, fitness and recreational leader, my concern for future basketball
players and all athletes in the competitive arena becomes relevant. No risk is worth one’s life
regardless of age, potential earnings, points per game or star power. My solution, with or without
the Genetics Information Nondiscriminatory
Act, screen young athletes with
electrocardiographic technology, find those at risk, take precautions and monitor them as they
perform.
