            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A theory claims your heart is as big as your fist. An unclenched fist shows we all have
various hand sizes with long, short, wide, or skinny fingers. As well, our palms range in mass or
detail. Of course, our hands grow as we do, as we develop, work, and grow old. So does our
heart. A person can learn much from another’s hands and if they’ve heard the theory before, they
can guess the size of one’s heart. Certainly with assorted hand sizes, we all have various heart
sizes. One key difference though, is if our hands stop working we can hopefully manage to go
about our life. If our heart stops working, so does life and so do we.
Think again if you consider today’s technology complex. Think twice more if you’ve ever
thought a superstar athlete worked harder than any other employee. The single most complex
hardest working individual machine is the heart. As such, a computer is turned off at times, an
athlete has an off season, both are able to rest and rehabilitate their bodies but the heart doesn’t
have this privilege. The heart doesn’t stop, it doesn’t rest ever, or at least until it does, which
doesn’t necessarily mean it is capable of ever starting back up again.
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the heart does stop suddenly, it is known as sudden cardiac death (SCD), the result
of a cardiovascular disease, anomaly or defect, which most tragically occurs in young athletes.
The most common conditions causing SCD are cardiomyopathies, which can be restrictive or
dilated but are defined as chronic diseases of the heart muscle. Cardiomyopathies often go
undetected in youth because at rest, athletes rarely indicate more than a slight heart murmur and
often times have no known pre existing issue or family history. The disease affects just 2% of the
general population (Leger). There are also congenital coronary artery anomalies, acquired heart
malformations and syndromes such as Long QT and Brugada that cause SCD (Leger). Although
possible, other conditions to cause SCD such as heat stroke, cerebral aneurysm, blunt trauma and
sickle cell are not nearly as prevalent in the student athlete nor do they necessarily pertain to the
athlete’s heart.
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sole result of the aforementioned scenarios, SCD, is certainly a tragedy but a million of them is
a statistic. Unfortunately, that statistic is not impactful often enough to be considered a dire
statistic on par with cancer or diabetes, or I’d imagine a more stringent protocol to be in place.
According to the 36th Bethesda Conference, cardiac arrest occurs in 1-2:1000 persons of the
general population per year. In a subgroup of adolescents or young adults, that ratio becomes
1:100,000 persons per year. Laura Leger, of Lausanne University Hospital whose
recommendations were adopted by the International Olympic Committee, suggests SCD occurs
in approximately 2:100,000 youth athletes (Leger, 1). Barry Maron, a cardiologist and Director
of the Heart Institute at Minneapolis Center for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, claimed non
traumatic death in male college basketball players was as prevalent as 1 in 28,818 (Kent, 21).
SCD becomes much more prevalent in the world population, affecting 1 in every 1000-3000
(Vatta, 738).
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, that one person will drop to the floor as if a rag doll, most likely in competition,
possibly on television and almost certainly in front of teammates, fans, coaches, school
administration or maybe even parents and the media. This was the case for Hank Gathers of
Loyola Marymount in 1990 and Reggie Lewis of the Seattle Supersonics in 1993, both of whom
collapsed on national television mid competition due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathies (HCM),
which affect 1 in every 500 persons worldwide (Vatta, 740). In each instance, what was
witnessed had long been written on the wall. It simply wasn’t screened for and identified
efficiently or early enough.
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends a 12 question survey as the
standard preparticipation screening throughout the United States. The survey has 5
considerations related to personal history such as chest pain, syncope, unexplained dyspnea/
fatigue, previous recognized heart murmur and elevated systolic BP. Three other questions relate
to family history, specifically instances of premature death, heart disease in relatives or other
cardiac conditions in family members. The final four considerations are determined through a
physical examination and seek to identify any heart murmur, femoral pulse, physical stigmata
and brachial blood pressure (Maron, 1646). Any affirmation creates a red flag and could indicate
the necessity for further screening, potentially disallowing participation until further consultation
with a specialist at the primary physician's discretion. In comparison, physicians in Italy are held
criminally negligent for improperly allowing an athlete to participate with an undetected
abnormality that results in death and so ECGs are administered as pre participation screening.
The question then becomes how can one not take these precautions? As if an ECG would not
have detected that the 7’2” Atlanta Hawks center, Jason Collier, whose death was contributed to
HCM had a heart that was 1.5 times the size of normal?
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side is to question prohibiting an athlete from their love of the game? Why would
anyone want to prevent a grown person from living out their childhood dream? After all, isn’t
there an inherent risk throughout sport? Can’t one’s heart stop beating from exertion just as
easily as their brain might stop from a concussion? Barry Maron will argue that in doing so, their
life could be saved from SCD. In 2005, the Chicago Bulls were faced with a similar dilemma.
Should a slight heart murmur prevent Eddy Curry from participation or should they dive deeper
into the realm of human genetics to determine whether their first round draft pick and local
superstar had a predisposition to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we dive into genetics, let’s first cover the basics. As small as the heart is, it
becomes quite complex with just four chambers; the left and right atrium and each side’s
ventricle. Each of the four chambers has their own responsibility pertaining to the oxygenation,
deoxygenation and dispersal of blood flow during diastolic and systolic phases. Similar to
Einstein’s theory of force, there is a contraction and a reaction, the heart opens and closes
constantly, always. A true marriage as two beats take place with every pump of blood from
before birth until death. All four chambers with their adjoining arteries and veins are in a
sequenced rhythm. These rhythms are received from the sinus node and are subsequently shown
on a 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG), which is what the European Society of Cardiology
recommends as a preparticipation exam. It’s also part of any polygraph test to detect liars.
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, the rhythm of your heart is determined unspecifically as there are many
components that factor into the synchronization of your heart’s muscles. Although the rhythm
may stem from the sinus node, Eric Topol, the director of Scripps Translational Science Institute
and co author of The Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine, describes stroke volume, venous
capacities, hemoglobin concentrations, oxygen efficiencies, vagal tones and most commonly
found in aerobic athletes, cardiac enlargements as influencers (Topol, 687). These factors
contribute to the heart’s tendencies that fluctuate rhythms but also affect specific chambers such
as the left or right ventricle, or either atriums. Many conditions can develop with each
component determining the heart’s performance, such as various arrhythmias, sinus bradycardia,
atrioventricular conduction delay, vasovagal syncope or atrial fibrillation (Topol, 689). Each of
these conditions can be determined by an ECG and indicate a larger problem, the Athletic Heart
Syndrome (AHS).
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Barry Maron, the Director of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy at the
Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation, AHS is, “a benign increase in cardiac mass, with
specific circulatory and cardiac morphological alterations,” (The Heart of Trained Athletes,
1633). Eric Topol agrees and describes AHS as “a constellation of clinical, electrocardiographic
and echocardiographic variants of normal found in well trained athletes” (686). However, AHS
has expanded in recent years and controversy does arise as to whether the syndrome is
physiologically or pathologically adapted, benign or specific to trained athletes and further, what
may be the pronounced effects (Maron, 1633). The controversy should then be focused on
understanding how to identify AHS from all the other complexities or diseases of the heart and
how much of AHS is related to SCD. What we do know is that AHS is often indicated by an
increase in the left ventricle (LV).
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry Maron seems determined to find answers and in 2009, he published Sudden Deaths
in Young Competitive Athletes. In the article, 1,866 SCD cases were analyzed and hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM) was found to be the contributing factor in 36% of the cases. The next
most frequent contributing factor he found related to SCD was coronary artery anomalies at 17%
(Sudden Deaths, 1086). HCM is an inherited disease characterized by an enlarged LV, which in
the most severe cases can cause SCD by ventricular fibrillation due to poor blood outflow with
decreased filling of the LV. Symptoms can also include hypotension, syncope or palpitations
(Leger et al, 4). HCM is also often mistaken for AHS as each affects the LV.
In The Sports Gene, author David Epstein describes HCM in chapter 15, The Heartbreak Gene,
as a true broken heart. The hereditary disease not only enlarges the LV but more discreetly,
causes specific areas of the LV walls to thicken (Epstein, 245). Similar to AHS, the LV is then
unable to relax completely between beats and can impede blood flow into the heart itself. With
his son, Martin Maron, a cardiologist at Tufts University Medical Center, they have progressed in
determining specific parameters in left ventricular wall thickness. The duo determined that the
crossover gray area where an enlarged heart can be either AHS or HCM is a LV wall thickness
between 13 and 15 millimeters. Indicators of HCM are then LV cavities less than 45mm, left
atrial enlargement, bizarre ECG patterns, abnormal LV filling or simply, family history of HCM
(Circulation, 1640). If the LV cavity is greater than 55mm or thickness decreases with
deconditioning then AHS would the diagnosis. These enlargements can be determined by
amplified waves in an echocardiograph (Topol, 690).
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Maron family has focused on the heart’s hardware, the Harvard affiliated Partners
HealthCare Center for Personalized Genetics, as mentioned in The Sports Gene, has focused on
its software. As of the book’s release, 18 different genes and 1,452 mutations of HCM have been
found, most of which are related to protein in the heart and hereditary . The geneticists have even
pinpointed the common cause within each mutation. It is considered a “missense,” where a single
letter is swapped in the DNA code at such an important place, that it changes the amino acid that
goes into making the resulting protein.The analogy is made to a layer of bricks as the athlete’s
heart. With HCM, the bricks are not layered properly so intense activity may cause the fatal short
circuit, which would not be the case for those with AHS. Similarly, if just a single brick is
exchanged for another that doesn’t belong or serve the same purpose, the signals sent from the
sinus node that create your heart’s rhythm can get lost or misconstrued and again, cause that fatal
disruption (Epstein, 245).
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the variables set and medical staff aware of what it might be that would indicate a
potential risk, whether that is specific measurements or gene sequences of the heart, why are
those not included in a preparticipation screening. One of the 12 questions recommended by the
AHA could easily read, “Do you have the MYH7 or the MYBPC3 gene?” Both of which are
connected to HCM (Vatta, 740). Unfortunately, one will not know that answer until clinical
genetic testing becomes more widespread, which is precisely what is posed by Matteo Vatta MD
and published in The Journal of Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine. Even then, it is a realm
untouched by athletic departments. For one to utilize that technology and what has been coined
by Matteo Vatta as “next generation sequencing (NGS)” to further identify SCD syndromes will
have a vast array of consequences. Already, even without the widespread use of the technology,
Congress has passed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) that sets privacy
standards and prohibits employers and insurers from discriminating against anyone with
particular genes. GINA offers the protections Eddy Curry needed when he was approached and
subsequently traded by the Chicago Bulls management.
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue becomes the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Act), which affords persons with
disabilities the right to not be prohibited from a “major life activity” if they can be considered
“otherwise qualified” in the absence of “substantial risk.” This disputation as it relates to a heart
ailment was argued in Knapp vs Northwestern beginning in 1996. The case also heavily
influenced the 36th Bethesda Conference’s medical eligibility and disqualification
recommendations (Mitten, 1374). In brief, the scholarship basketball player, Nicholas Knapp,
was ruled ineligible by Northwestern University’s team physician due to a prior ventricular
fibrillation (VF) episode and subsequent implantation of an internal cardiac defibrillator (ICD) all
before enrolling at the university. Knapp’s claim was that he was being restricted from a “major
life activity,” which was learning, albeit through the game of basketball and that his rights should
be protected by the Act (Spingola, 709).
A federal circuit court of the Northern District of Illinois (circuit court) sided with his argument
and agreed his condition does not put him at “substantial risk” and that he is “otherwise
qualified” to partake in a “major life activity” under section 504 of the Act (Spingola, 710). It
should be noted that the Act requires the court to make this determination and serve as final
arbiter on a case by case basis to protect the rights of both the person disabled and organizations
seeking to prevent harm or risk. Additionally, it is should be mentioned the court does not permit
“paternalistic authorities” that may attempt to determine precisely what is “too risky” pertaining
to future unforeseen events (Spingola, 712, 721).
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an emergency appeal by Northwestern’s athletic director, the risk factor of Nicholas
Knapp’s condition was again presented to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit (appellate
court), by an individualized assessment led by Knapp’s primary cardiologist and two of the
leading electrophysiologists in the country, whereas Northwestern University relied heavily upon
general medical guidelines presented by experts, one of which was Barry Maron. Of course, the
court was presented with conflicting medical opinion and although the circuit court favored
Nicholas Knapp, the appellate court disagreed and notioned for the decision to be left for the
university and team physicians so long as that determination is reasonable (Spingola, 709).
Suzanna Dodd Weissenburger MD of Clemson University explains this as the court’s multiple
models of decision making pertaining to medical assessments. The model used by the circuit
court in the Knapp case was the judicial/medical fact-finding model. There is then the athlete
informed consent model, which the athlete is to determine so long as they waive liabilities. The
third is the team physician model that was used by the appellate court, which relinquished
assessment to the team physician (Weissenburger, 42). However, prior to the Knapp case, it was
the Act that held the court to weigh those opinions and make final judgement. As determination
was given to the university, the court held that they were only to ensure the university had done
so reasonably. This determination allowed the appellate court to reverse the circuit court’s initial
decision with much scrutiny and purported contrasts to prior Supreme Court case law. For
example, as Northwestern emphasized the amount of risk, regardless of substantiality, it is in
conflict with the court’s point of view that prohibits “paternalistic authorities (Spingola, 722).”
Furthermore, it preceded the appellate court’s ruling that Nicholas Knapp was not “substantially
limited” to learn with his impairment, and therefore not protected by the Act. That is to say
Knapp could play basketball and learn elsewhere, just not for Northwestern University’s
basketball team. This is in contradiction to the ruling in EE Black vs Marshall case that
interpreted the Act to cover highly trained professionals such as carpenters, or potentially in
Knapp’s case, basketball players (Spingola, 733).
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, pertaining to the “major life activity” and unique learning experiences provided by
sports and contrary to previous decisions in Poole vs South Plainfield Board of Education and
Wright vs Columbia University, Nicholas Knapp’s opportunities to learn were not impeded
against solely by his ineligibility on the basketball court. As well, it went against a Michigan
district court that had determined interscholastic sports to be a subset of learning, heavily
influencing grades by social relationships, encouraging discipline and study habits. The appellate
court’s summary judgement dismissed these cases and concluded Nicholas Knapp still had been
afforded plenty of opportunity to learn with Northwestern still committing to him a scholarship,
an opportunity to watch and travel with the team and an education (Spingola, 715).
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summary judgement by the appellate court also determined Nicholas Knapp was not
“otherwise qualified” to play intercollegiate basketball due to his inability to pass the
preparticipation exam. Referring back to the Poole decision, a wrestler with one kidney was
ruled ineligible due to his inability to pass the physical examination. The court however, favored
the wrestler to be “otherwise qualified” and found him covered by the Act as he was unable to
pass the physical examination because of his disability (Spingola, 721). In comparison, Nicholas
Knapp’s initial “otherwise qualified” decision was overturned by the appellate court. An analogy
for this argument is similar to that of arguing which came first, the chicken or the egg?
Luckily for Knapp, his case came before The Sutton Trilogy, which established “mitigating
factors” such as eyewear, prosthetics or ICDs (Weissenburger, 41.) In essence, Nicholas Knapp
would not have been considered disabled due to his ICD but then, would he have then been
disqualified by Northwestern’s team physicians? At the time, no collegiate or professional player
had ever competed with an ICD (Mitten, 1374). One might compare it to a double edged sword,
how can the disability be nullified if there was still risk? In the Knapp case, the medical
professionals could not agree and so the decision was left to Northwestern University.
As mentioned, there was much opinion around the Knapp case as it had changed the judicial
landscape since the protections of a minority group were first introduced with the Act and the
subsequent ADA standards. Legislators of each delineated the context of each act be quite loose,
as it was intended to prevent limitations. However, the undetermined and unsettled gauges of
“substantial,” “qualified,” and “major” present the court with much to consider on a case by case
basis, which is also suggested within the context. And so, it can not be said that any of the rulings
are wrong, only that they are inconsistent.
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As recently as 2010, the Chicago Tribune summarized Nicholas Knapp’s opinion to indicate:
“He believes strongly the NCAA has an obligation to force its members to screen
incoming student-athletes for heart abnormalities. But if they detect problems,
institutions shouldn't make decisions that aren't theirs to make the way
Northwestern did for him (Haugh).”
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question becomes how can sport, fitness and recreation leaders agree on a fused
preparticipation screening program in accordance with medical guidelines and legislation? The
AHA had an event in 2014, where 1,266 attendees representing 86 countries voted and 60%
suggested that program include an ECG (Chatard, 3). Of course, it’s easier said than done, much
less implemented properly. It’s possible in Italy, which has required an ECG every two years for
all athletes between the ages of 12-35 since 1980, in which they’ve subsequently witnessed an
89% decrease in SCD. As well, rates among regions and populations remain dissimilar. For
example, the variance among U.S. high school athletes compared to African American basketball
players is 1:917000 to 1:3000 (Chatard, 1). Although one can find great variance among
countries, the established program in Italy brought the rate of SCD from 3.6:100,000 in 1980 to .
4:100,000 in 2004 (Chatard, 2). Although after a 12 year screening program in Israel, the
variance remained unchanged at 2.6:100,00. So while effective in Italy, how feasible is a similar
program with a population 4-5 times the size?
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry Maron poses many obstacles to overcome in his 2007 Update of Recommendations and
Considerations Related to Preparticipation Screening for Cardiovascular Abnormalities in
Competitive Athletes, many of which are conferred by JC Chatard. To begin, no legislation or
legal requirements exist enforcing sports conferences or governing bodies to implement any
screening process at all. The AHA only offers recommendations which are followed by team or
personal physicians held to provide a certain standard of care. Although varied by state, it’s
simply the physician’s legal duty to use reasonable care in detecting abnormalities but they are
also the ones permitted, in accordance with their peers, to establish such practices. The notion of
liability for SCD also influences these guidelines as the 12 question screening serves as a
minimal bar to avoid malpractice (Maron, 1646). One could guess, if physicians were held liable
as if they were in Italy, standards would certainly become more rigid. Barry Maron also
describes a precise unknowing factor. At the moment, the AHA recommendations are feasible by
all physicians. If an ECG were to be implemented, vast scores of physicians may opt out of
providing such screenings, drastically limiting the number of physicians available. Hence, the
necessity for law and medical practices to be in concurrence to provide consistent, reliable and
cost effective procedures (Maron, 1646).
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations also include analyzation of cost effectiveness. Barry Maron hypothesizes
fairly specific estimates for 10 million youth, middle and high school aged. Implementing the
ECG screen adds a fifty dollar value to the twenty five dollars being reimbursed by Medicare for
the 12 question screening, totaling $750 million. With an estimated 15% prevalence rate, 1.5
million youth athletes will need additional cardiac evaluation. This would include a second
history and physical exam, which reimburses $100 by Medicare in addition to a 2-dimensional
echocardiogram, reimbursed by Medicare at $400 each, totaling another $750 million. The total
so far at $1.5 billion does not include administrative or operational costs which Barry Maron
estimates at $500 million. Assuming the known prevalence rate to be true and found with a mass
cardiovascular screening process, Barry Maron figures the cost to theoretically save each life at
risk would be $3.4 million (Maron, 1649).
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JC Chatard describes a much more indirect estimate from analyzation of the Italian program,
which figured to save 2.06 life years per 1000 athletes diagnosed via ECG (Chatard, 7). The
argument for an ECG in preparticipation screening is only presumed because of the European
Society of Cardiology’s recommendations and the Lausanne recommendations adopted by the
IOC in addition to Italy’s preparticipation screening program success. JC Chatard poses many
more exams that could specify one’s risk of SCD. One is a maximal stress test, which is a
cardiopulmonary exercise test. There is the 24 hour Holter recording, which is recommended to
include an exercise session to further pinpoint arrhythmias or palpitations. CMR Imaging is a
preferred method to more distinctly visualize cardiomyopathies. An electrophysiological study
and the signal averaged ECG are both specific to various particular patterns found on the normal
ECG. And finally, there are pharmacological and genetic tests to determine hereditary diseases
that may show positive, negative or inconclusive (Chatard, 9).
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neurologist Barry Jordan was the former chief medical officer of the New York State Athletic
Commission and once considered making genetic screening mandatory for all boxers in New
York. In The Sports Gene, he states, “I don’t think you can stop an athlete from participating, but
it might help just in monitoring them closely (Epstein, 255).” This point of view goes along well
with Nicholas Knapp’s opinion. For some student athletes, competition, exercise and sport is
their life, regardless of their profession. To quote Vince Lombardi, “I firmly believe that any
man’s finest hour, the greatest fulfillment of all that he holds dear, is that moment when he has
worked his heart out in a good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle, victorious.” So how
can one ask an athlete to give up the ball they hold so close to their heart? In the 21st century,
technology has brought people back to life. ICDs have jump started ceased athletes such as
Belgian soccer star, Anthony Van Loo, who went into cardiac arrest during a match. Within
seconds of syncope and falling flatly to the ground, he twitched and rose to his feet as if nothing
had happened (Epstein, 251). Although, Eric Topol may consider this outdated technology as he
does the stethoscope, which was invented in 1816. One hundred years later and Eric is convinced
wireless technology is transforming medical fields across the globe from vital signs, glucose
levels, sleep pattern, fetal heart rates and intra uterine contractions all being shown on a
smartphone. As it pertains to the ailments of one’s heart, GE has released a focused
cardiographic ultrasound, which too can be streamed to a smartphone. Although reliability and
efficiencies can be argued at the moment, a simple innovation to track pings from multiple
wearable and wireless pads or devices can enhance that process. In order to approach that point
of taking the next leap forward, we must embrace the risk. For if we don’t allow a heart with
anomalies to exercise and develop, how will our physician’s understanding of such anomalies?
</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar argument can be specific to football. Especially now with the NFL’s acknowledgement
of various studies linking concussions to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), how many
hits to the head does it take to medically disqualify a player? The point being there is substantial
risk living in an urban environment. Should we be disqualified from choosing which streets we
walk down, or should contingencies be put in place to offset that risk such as speed cameras, or
security cameras? You can’t disqualify a disabled person from accessing public space, just as you
shouldn’t be able to disqualify an otherwise qualified athlete from competition. Believe that there
is enough paper in this country to sign plentiful liability waiver forms. Also, believe there is
enough paper to fund additional preparticipation screening processes, if not to save one’s life
from SCD, then to assist the cardiologists in deciphering the risks and complexities of such
variances.
